Scanner Search and Replace
--------------------------

I. DESCRIPTION:

The Search and Replace Scanner can do regular expression matches
against a configurable list of title, body and text fields.
This is useful for finding html strings that Drupal's normal search will
ignore. It can also replace the matched text. Very handy if you are changing
the name of your company, or are changing the URL of a link included
multiple times in multiple nodes.


II. LIMITATIONS:

1. A user can only have one instance of Search and Replace Scanner running at a time.
Attempting to open Scanner in two separate windows to perform replacements at the
same time can lead to unknown errors if you encounter a timeout.

2. Only works on sites using a MySQL database.

3. Large search and replace actions may not be completed on sites that are
hosted in environments where PHP's max_execution_time variable can't be
dynamically expanded. The module automatically attempts to expand the
maximum execution time of a script to 10 minutes. (It's often set at 2 minutes.)
If your Web host doesn't let you adjust this variable dynamically, you may be
able to ask your hosting provider to make the change for your account.


III. WARNING:

This is a very powerful tool, and as such is very dangerous. You can easily
destroy your entire site with it. Be sure to backup your database before using
it. No, really.


IV. FEATURES:

1. Plain text search and replace.

2. Regular expression search and replace.

3. Case sensitive search option.

4. Plain text search allows 'whole word' matching option. For example,
searching for "run" with the whole word option selected will filter out
"running" and "runs", but will match "run!".

5. You can specify text that should precede or follow the search text in order for a match to be valid.

6. Can limit search and replace to published nodes only.

7. Can search and replace on text fields, in addition to the node title.

8. Searches can be limited to specific fields in specific node types.

9. Searches can be further limited by nodes containing specific taxonomy terms.

10. Will save a new node revision when a replacement is made, in case you want
to revert a change.

11. Provides an Undo option that lets you revert all nodes that were udpated in
a specific replacement action.

12. Updates summary part of text fields that use 'Text area with a summary' widget.

13. Will dynamically expand PHP's maximum execution time for scripts up to
10 minutes on servers that support it. This allows complex queries on large
bodies of content.

14. Search results for searches and replacements can be themed.
