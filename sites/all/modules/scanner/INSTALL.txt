Scanner Search and Replace
--------------------------

BEFORE YOU START:

Backup your database! Scanner Search and Replace is a very powerful tool, and
as such is very dangerous. You can easily destroy your entire site with it. Be
sure to backup your database before using it. No, really.


I. INSTALLATION:

http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7

1. Place the entire scanner folder in your sites/all/modules directory.

2. Go to [Administration -> Modules] and enable the scanner module.

3. Go to [Administration -> People -> Permissions] and apply your
preferred access settings to the scanner module. You can set which roles can
administer the module -- e.g., determine which fields can be scanned and modify
defaults -- and which roles can use the module. This is is handy if, say, you
only want the site admin to administer the module, but you want content
managers to be able to perform search and replace actions.

4. Go to the Scanner administration panel and select which fields you want to
include in search and replace actions. More information on that is available
below in the Administration Options section.


II. ADMINISTRATION OPTIONS:

You can access the Scanner admin settings two ways:

- Go to [Administration -> Configuration -> Search and Replace Scanner].

- Go to [Administration -> Content -> Search and Replace Scanner] and
select the "Settings" tab.

A. Default Options:

In this section, you can set the defaults for several search options that
Scanner users will see when they use the search and replace form. Users will
still be able to change the options on their own, but the defaults can make
things easier for them if they're likely to only perform one kind of search
most of the time.

You can also select whether teasers for nodes should be rebuilt after a
replacement has been made to the body or other fields for that node. Most
admins will select this option, because it ensures that teasers are in synch
with node content. But see section II.A above for more info on why leaving
this option unselected might be helpful.

If your site has categories set up in the Taxonomy module, you can restrict
search and replace actions to nodes that contain terms in a given category
(a.k.a "vocabulary"). Select the vocabularies that you want to allow
restricting by. When users go to the search and replace form, they will have
the option of selecting one or more terms from those vocabularies for limiting
their searches.

B. Fields that can be searched:

The most important part of administering Scanner is making sure you select one
or more options in the "Fields that can be searched" section. Fields are listed
in [nodetype: fieldname] format. If you only want to allow people with access
to search and replace on the Body field of the Basic Page content type,
select [page: body].
